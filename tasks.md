# Tasks — Cycle 4: Polish → Stable v1

**Target:** Take the three shipped core features (notes, routines, budget) to a stable,
daily-usable v1. Completion bar is deliberately subjective: **"polish until the app is
comfortable to use daily."**

**Status:** Cycle 4 Session 4 (Planning) complete 2026-06-06. Phase 1 is the first
implementation target (Session 5). Plan file: `~/.claude/plans/vivid-cooking-kurzweil.md`.

**Operating model — dogfooding is the test harness.** The user will use the app heavily;
real daily friction is the primary bug-finder. The plan front-loads "make it livable enough
to live in" (Phase 1), then daily use feeds the **Running friction log** below, which is
triaged into whichever phase is live. Scope creep is expected and has a home here.

**Scope:** open-core public/private split (one-way door) · extensibility mechanism
(subprocess plugins + config-selection) · stable VPS + deploy · real-data go-live import
(Cycle-3 6.5) · editor daily-use foundation + properties panel · release polish (logo,
branch-gate, v1 stamp).

**Strategy:** Sequential. No parallel worktrees (`feedback_parallel_agents_cost.md`).
Subagent default model = `opus` (`feedback_subagent_default_model.md`). Throttle workspace
cargo with `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2` (`feedback_throttle_workspace_cargo.md`).

## Design decisions (settled Session 4, 2026-06-06)

1. **Extensibility = one mechanism, two shapes.** (a) Subprocess plugins for data sources
   (generalizes the private overlay's user-provided-driver pattern). (b) Config-selection for
   provider-swaps — bring-your-own-LLM first (one OpenAI-compatible `LlmClient` impl + config:
   base URL/model/key; covers local Ollama/llama.cpp + commercial APIs); `DocumentExtractor`
   on the same rail. Behavior/automation extension deferred (mechanism won't preclude it).
   **Add-mechanism:** scripts placed on the server manually (kept low-friction), all wiring
   in-app; config is in-app data, scripts are *not* uploaded-and-executed (no RCE surface).
2. **Stable VPS** is a committed deliverable (prereq for laptop-free sync + extensibility).
3. **Keep the custom CodeMirror editor**; close the daily-use gap rather than pivot to Obsidian.
4. **State continuity = full rework.** Lift per-page state into a root-held store (survives
   navigation) AND persist workspace *position* to disk (survives Android app-kill / restart).
   Content safety comes from hardened auto-save, not hot-exit.
5. **Properties UI = full inline panel** (Obsidian-style), stays on top of the note; typed
   widgets for the small known vocabulary; scroll-up to reach on mobile (acceptable — fields
   auto-fill / reflections are end-of-day).
6. **Keyboard occlusion fix** = extend the existing Android inset bridge with the IME inset.
7. **Navigation = drawer opened by BOTH edge-swipe and a button.** Edge-swipe verified viable
   on Android (`setSystemGestureExclusionRects`); button is the never-misfires fallback. No
   upfront validation lock-in — on-device friction will surface it.

## Phase 1 — Daily-use foundation *(unblocks dogfooding; do first)* `(logbook)`

- [x] **1.1** Root continuity store: `use_context_provider` at app root (`tauri-app/frontend/src/main.rs`, joins existing tz/pending-share contexts), state keyed by identity (note path / capture-id / list-instance). [M]
- [x] **1.2** Migrate journal editor (`pages/journal.rs`) to the store; drop page ownership of `content`/`last_saved_content`/save loop. [M]
- [x] **1.3** Migrate generic notes editor (`pages/notes.rs`) to the store. [M]
- [x] **1.4** Migrate in-flight finances captures (Phase-3 gap) into the store keyed by capture-id; "in-flight capture" affordance on Home. [M]
- [x] **1.5** Migrate transaction-list pagination state (`transactions`/`offset` signals) into the store keyed by list-instance — fixes nav-to-detail-and-back reset (`project.md` carry). [S]
- [x] **1.6** ~~Relocate the auto-save loop into the store~~ — **resolved via lean path (B), 2026-06-06.** Post-1.2–1.5 the store already retains unsaved content and re-fires the save on remount (covers nav-away-and-back); no root save daemon (avoids the id-writeback coordination). The `edit → leave → never-return → app-kill` gap folds into the extended 1.8 (persist the store to disk). Decision rationale in memory `project-autosave-robustness-b`. [M]
- [x] **1.7** Auto-save resilience: retry/backoff on failure + a glanceable save-state indicator (saved / saving / unsaved / failed). [S] — shared `autosave.rs` (`SaveState` + `save_with_retry` + `SaveIndicator`); backoff policy = exp 500/1000/2000/4000ms × 4 then fail; wired into journal + notes auto-save & manual save.
- [x] **1.8** Workspace persistence (Level 2-A) — **split a/b:**
  - [x] **1.8a** Store persistence (closes the 1.6 kill-gap): serde on store value types + `PersistedWorkspace` (maps as `Vec<(key,val)>` — serde_json rejects enum map keys); backend `get_workspace`/`save_workspace` (JSON file in `app_data_dir`, mirrors `commands/settings.rs`) + bridge fns + mock stubs; boot-load (writer-gated on `loaded`) + debounced write-back in `use_continuity_provider`. Frontend clippy clean + backend `omni-me-app` check clean. **Not yet run against real disk** (mock has no backend — verify in next full-app/on-device run).
  - [x] **1.8b** Position restoration — **done 2026-06-06, two slices.** *Slice 1 (cursor/scroll):* `EditSession.cursor` (`#[serde(default)]`) + CodeMirror interop (`editor.js`: `onCursor`/`initialCursor` in options, selection-aware update listener, `clampCursor` = `Math.min(pos,len)` so a shrunk doc drops the caret at end, `getEditorCursor` unmount fallback) + `js_get_editor_cursor` extern + `Editor` `initial_cursor`/`on_cursor` props; journal + notes capture-via-`on_cursor`/hydrate/mirror; restore is selection-only so it never flips dirty. *Slice 2 (nav):* `NavState` (string-typed, dependency-free) in the store + `nav_peek`/`update_nav`/`is_loaded`; `Tab::as_key`/`from_key`; boot tab-restore future (gated on `loaded`, pending-share still wins); journal date+subtab and notes view(Edit/List)+subtab restore-on-load/mirror-back (New→List on restore — draft content preserved by slice 1). *Boot race:* page hydration now waits on `store.loaded_peek()` so the initially-open page sees the disk snapshot. **Playwright-verified (mock, in-memory tier):** journal caret 3 + notes caret 21 restored across remount w/o dirtying; notes open-note + journal day (June 12) restored across tab round-trip; clean reload → Journal/Today defaults; 0 console errors. **Disk tier (boot-after-kill restore of caret/nav) shares these code paths but needs a real backend — same on-device bucket as 1.8a.** Frontend clippy clean (mock + default). [M]
- [x] **1.9** Keyboard occlusion — **impl 2026-06-06; on-device bug found + fixed 2026-06-07.** `InsetBridge.kt`: read `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.ime()` inside the *existing* content-root listener (chained), cache `ime.bottom` in CSS px, inject `--keyboard-inset-bottom`. `:root` default `0px` in `input.css`. **On-device (Android 10 / API 29):** `--keyboard-inset-bottom` stayed `0px` with keyboard up (systemBars inset worked = bridge fires; `Type.ime()` specifically read 0). Root cause (confirmed via Android docs): `Type.ime()` is a first-class inset only since API 30; on API 29 the androidx backport needs the window in `adjustResize`. **Fix:** added `android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"` to the activity in `android-overrides/AndroidManifest.xml` (pairs with the existing `enableEdgeToEdge()` = `setDecorFitsSystemWindows(false)`). Re-verifying on device. [M]
- [x] **1.10** Web caret-above-keyboard — **done 2026-06-06 (impl; on-device verify rides 1.13).** `.pb-mobile-nav` padding adds `var(--keyboard-inset-bottom)` so the scroll column gains room when the IME is up. `editor.js`: `visualViewport` resize/scroll listener + `keepCaretAboveKeyboard()` (rAF-coalesced) compares `coordsAtPos(head)` against `visualViewport.height` and nudges the nearest `overflow-y:auto` ancestor (`findScrollParent`, gate-free so it targets the main column reliably despite the padding/event race; `body` is `overflow:hidden`); also called on doc/selection changes. **Browser-checked:** var resolves `0px`, `visualViewport` present, scroll-parent lookup resolves to the `pb-mobile-nav` column, 0 console errors, editor functional. Real occlusion needs a device. [S]
- [x] **1.11** Nav drawer — **done 2026-06-06 (model A: mobile drawer replaces bottom nav, desktop keeps SideNav).** New `NavDrawer` (scrim + slide-in panel, both always-rendered + class-toggled so the transform animates) replaces `BottomNav` (component removed); header gains an `md:hidden` hamburger (`mr-auto` keeps the sync chip right; `justify-end` keeps it right at md+). `.pb-mobile-nav` dropped its 4rem bottom-bar reserve → `1.5rem + safe-area + keyboard`. **Playwright-verified (390px):** hamburger opens drawer, scrim dims content, destination tap navigates + auto-closes, scrim tap closes; (1280px) persistent SideNav, no hamburger. Screenshots in `logbook/_assets/phase1-nav-drawer/`. Clippy clean. [M]
- [x] **1.12** Edge-swipe open — **done 2026-06-06 (web verified; native rides 1.13).** *Web:* root-shell `ontouchstart`/`move`/`end` track a touch that *starts* in the left `EDGE_SWIPE_START_PX`(24) strip while the drawer is closed and opens it once it travels `EDGE_SWIPE_OPEN_PX`(48) right; no `preventDefault`, so scroll/typing untouched. **Synthetic-touch-verified:** edge swipe (x8→x80) opens; mid-screen swipe (x200→x280) is a no-op; 0 console errors. *Native:* `InsetBridge.applyGestureExclusion` sets `systemGestureExclusionRects` on the content root for a 24dp left strip (API 29+, re-applied on the boot schedule since `root.height` is 0 early; OS clamps the height, so best-effort — hamburger stays the guaranteed opener). Not compiled (no Android build this session). [M]
- [x] **1.13** On-device APK verification (Samsung, Android 10 / API 29) — **COMPLETE 2026-06-08:** 1.9 inset + 1.10 caret-above-keyboard both verified on-device (caret clears the keyboard by the exact 24px margin). The real blocker — found after a long debug — was the build pipeline embedding a **stale debug frontend** (`frontendDist`=debug baked into the `.so`), so no JS change reached the device; fixed via `scripts/android-build.sh release` (see friction log + `BUILD.md`). 1.10 native-event fix: `InsetBridge` dispatches `omni:keyboardinset` → `editor.js` re-runs `keepCaretAboveKeyboard`. Pre-fix investigation notes:** Build pipeline issues found + fixed first: (1) release build OOM-froze the 7GB laptop → memory-safe env overrides (`CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO=false`/`CODEGEN_UNITS=16`/`OPT_LEVEL=1`, `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1`) + a MemAvailable watchdog; (2) APK shipped **mock** data because `frontendDist`=debug dir held a stale `dx serve --features mock` build (latent: `beforeBuildCommand` builds release but `frontendDist`=debug → android always bundles the debug dir) — rebuilt debug dir non-mock. APK signed with debug keystore, sideloaded. **Verified on real backend:** ✅ tab restore across app-kill (reopened on Finances — NavState lives only in the workspace file, not the DB); ✅ content persistence across kill (marker survived); ✅ caret restore across kill (`getEditorCursor`=156, non-zero, at edit point); ✅ drawer open + navigate; ✅ InsetBridge injects real `--safe-area-inset-bottom` (48px). **Found + fixing:** ❌ keyboard inset (1.9) — `adjustResize` fix building. **Still to check:** caret-above-keyboard (1.10) once 1.9 lands; edge-swipe is a no-op to test here (device is 3-button nav → no back-gesture conflict). [S]

## Phase 2 — Server go-live *(deploy — runs AFTER the Phase 3 split; kept lean until then)*

**Execution order (revised 2026-06-13):** **Phase 3 (split) runs before Phase 2 (deploy)** —
not parallel as originally framed. The deploy pipeline's *home and shape* depend on the split's
repo topology + the Model-A-vs-B image decision, and the current repo is already **public**, so
a personal deploy pipeline can't live there. Detailed deploy design is deferred until the split
settles, to avoid designing against a topology that will change (`feedback-sequence-by-dependency`).

**Decisions that survive the reorder** (`project-deploy-runtime`, `feedback-ci-cd-over-sysadmin`):
Docker container (not systemd); dual-provider (Hetzner + DO 60-day trial); one provider-neutral
image; Tailscale reachability (phone reaches the server by tailnet hostname); heavy CI/CD with
health-gated deploy + auto-rollback, SHA-tagged images, pre-deploy snapshots, one box at a time,
nothing exposed publicly. **The "deploy to my box" pipeline is homed on the private side** (private
overlay under Model A); only "build/test/publish the public image" stays public.

- [ ] **2.1** Containerize *runtime* config — split-agnostic, safe to prep anytime: `docker-compose` volume layout (surreal_data + blobs → one volume via `BLOB_DIR`), `/health` healthcheck, runtime secret mount (`credentials.toml` + `GEMINI_API_KEY`), `restart: unless-stopped`. [S]
- [ ] **2.2** Provision Hetzner + DO boxes (Ubuntu LTS, ~2GB RAM — CI builds the image, box only runs it) + Docker + Tailscale bootstrap. [USER] — **defer DO until deploy is ready so the 60-day trial clock doesn't burn idle; no box is needed for the split itself.**
- [ ] **2.3** Deploy pipeline — **DETAIL AFTER THE SPLIT** (homed per topology / Model A-vs-B): build the real image → push to the right registry → deploy over the tailnet → health-gate + auto-rollback → pre-deploy snapshot → dual-target rollout (DO then Hetzner). [—]
- [ ] **2.4** Verify go-live: **phone syncs against the VPS with the laptop OFF**; kill one box, the phone still syncs via the other. [S]
- [ ] **2.5** **Precondition MET 2026-06-17:** app-entered re-auth (3.5a / `SOURCE_REAUTH_DESIGN.md`) has shipped + is real-OTP-verified, so the private bank auto-import may run on the VPS — the SSH-for-OTP failure mode is gone. The remaining work here is just the deploy itself (Phase 2); it stays local-only only until the deploy pipeline lands. [—]

## Phase 3 — Open-core split + extensibility *(the one-way door — RUNS BEFORE Phase 2)* `(logbook)` `(demo?)`

**First decision when opening this phase:** Model A (bank adapters compiled into a private image;
deploy pipeline lives in the private overlay repo) vs Model B (public zero-source image everywhere;
bank adapters run as box-local subprocess plugins per 3.5 — deploy stays mostly public). Lean A now
(least work, matches 3.1–3.3), B as the end-state once the subprocess mechanism matures. This choice
sets the Phase 2 deploy topology.

**STATUS 2026-06-14 — STEP 1 (relocate) COMPLETE (3.1–3.3).** Destination resolved = Model B via a
foundation-first path. Private overlay `RustWright/omni-me-private` created + pushed (`main`@`8b07e83`)
+ registered as a `productive_learning` submodule; public engine bank-free + 446 tests/clippy clean;
private clippy clean + 23/23 adapter tests + green smoke test vs real config (graceful private-source degradation
verified live). SurrealDB pinned 3.0.4 in both repos (lockstep — see backlog).

**STATUS 2026-06-15 — STEP 2a (subprocess contract + first pull-helper) COMPLETE.** Froze the engine↔helper
JSON contract in prose (`SUBPROCESS_SOURCE_CONTRACT.md`) + code (`HelperRequest`/`HelperResponse`/
`HelperStatus` public serde types in `core::auto_import::subprocess`). Built the generic public
`SubprocessSource` (6 fake-helper tests). Converted the first bank adapter to a standalone helper binary in
the overlay (`fetch_drafts` + a `src/bin/<helper>.rs`) that **reads its own credentials** — the engine never
sees a bank secret (boundary now structural). Helper discovery = sibling-of-current-exe + an env override
(the convention all future plugins reuse). Hardened the `driver_script` path (engine validates the helper
command; helper resolves its driver to absolute + existence-checks). Public 6 new tests + clippy clean
(still bank-free); private builds both binaries + 22 tests + clippy clean. **Smoke-verified live:** the
source now ticks via `SubprocessSource → helper → vendor driver`; a real session-expiry → driver non-zero
exit → `needs_reauth` → graceful backoff, the other live sources unaffected. **STEP 2b = next session:**
app-OTP re-auth full stack (3.5a — `AuthState` + `/reauth` route + the helper's `reauth` verb (already
frozen in the contract) + Dioxus "Reconnect" UI). Deferred: a second adapter's helper; the email-handler
source (out-of-scope per the contract — stays in-process; recommended future shape = helper decrypts PDF,
engine extracts via LLM); real account-map (3.9).

**STATUS 2026-06-15 — STEP 2b (app-OTP re-auth backend slice, 3.5a server half) COMPLETE.** The
`needs_reauth` signal is now a tracked, exposed `AuthState` instead of a buried log line: new
`ImportError::NeedsReauth` + `AuthState`/`ReauthOutcome` public types + defaulted
`reauth`/`reauth_capable` trait methods + registry state-tracking (`record_tick` flips to
`NeedsReauth`; a clean tick or successful reauth clears it; a transient blip leaves it) + registry
`reauth()`. `SubprocessSource` threads the new variant and speaks the frozen `reauth` verb; the bank
helper runs its driver's fresh-login path (exit 0→`reauth_ok`, 4→`invalid_otp`, else→`error`); new
`POST /auto_import/reauth` (OTP in body, not URL); `GET /auto_import/status` now carries `auth_state` +
`reauth_capable`. Public +14 tests (62 auto-import) + clippy clean both feature configs + server clippy
clean; private +4 tests (26) + clippy clean + both bins rebuilt. **Live round-trip vs real config
(GREEN):** status exposes the fields (`reauth_capable` true only for the SubprocessSource, false for the
other live sources); a dummy-OTP reauth drove the *real* driver → `invalid_otp` (the driver already
supports the otp fresh-login path); unknown source→404; a non-capable source→`not_supported`; the
subprocess source's scheduler tick surfaced `needs re-auth` and backed off while the other sources ticked
clean. **Caught + fixed mid-verify:** the first round-trip ran a stale binary
(`cargo test` rebuilt the lib but didn't relink the bin) → explicit `cargo build`, re-verified.
**Deferred to next session (the rest of 3.5a):** Dioxus "Reconnect {source}" UI + OTP field +
Playwright + the real-OTP happy-path test. Contract docs + `SOURCE_REAUTH_DESIGN.md` updated.

**STATUS 2026-06-17 — STEP 2c (app-OTP re-auth CLIENT, 3.5a DONE) COMPLETE.** The Dioxus client now
drives the proven backend, finishing 3.5a. **Inline-in-row UX:** the existing Auto-Import Sources
settings row (`AutoImportRow`) grows an amber "Reconnect needed" callout + `Reconnect` button when a
source is `needs_reauth` + `reauth_capable`; the button expands an inline 6-digit OTP field whose
`Submit` calls the new `reauth_source` Tauri command → `POST /auto_import/reauth` (OTP in body). The
`ReauthOutcome` drives the row: `active`→success+collapse+parent re-pulls `/status`→healthy;
`invalid_otp`→"code rejected", field stays; `not_supported`/`error`→inline message. **The seam that
was silently swallowing the signal:** each proxy `AutoImportSourceView` (Tauri command layer +
frontend types) deserialized lossily, dropping the server's `auth_state`/`reauth_capable`; declared
both (`#[serde(default)]`) at every hop so it survives to the screen. Orthogonal to `health` (passive
"data flowing" vs imperative "user must act") — a degraded-but-active source shows no callout, only
`needs_reauth` does. Clippy clean (Tauri + frontend, both feature configs). **Playwright mock
walkthrough (5 states, 0 console errors):** the reauth-capable source shows the callout, others don't; Reconnect reveals the
field; `000000`→rejected (field stays); valid 6-digit→success→row returns healthy on refresh. PNGs in
`logbook/_assets/source-reauth-reconnect/`. **Real-OTP happy path proven E2E vs the real account**
(`cargo tauri dev` desktop → private server on real `credentials.toml`): a live TOTP flipped
`auth_state → active`, then a manual `Fetch now` came back `last_outcome: success` / `health: healthy`
— proving the **session refreshed**, not just the flag cleared (the two-clocks model: `registry.reauth`
only flips `auth_state`, so the successful pull is independent evidence). **This unblocks 2.5.**

**STATUS 2026-06-17 — 3.4 + 3.6 + 3.7 (public engine usable with no banks) COMPLETE.** The public
engine is now self-sufficient: it boots + runs clean with zero config (**3.4** — fixed a real
boot-time panic where the Gemini-key `.expect()` crashed a no-key install; now degrades to
`NullExtractor`/empty-key client), builds **generic sources from a server-side `sources.toml`** at
boot (**3.6** — native `CsvSource` + the existing `SubprocessSource`, via `core::auto_import::config`;
public binary rewired off `no_sources`), and lets the user **add/edit/remove those sources in-app**
(**3.7** — `GET/POST/DELETE /auto_import/sources` + a rebuilt Settings panel; restart-to-apply). Apply
model = restart-to-apply (user call "restart now, live later"); the running registry is never mutated,
so changes take effect on next server boot. **Verified:** 15 new `core` unit tests; clippy clean across
`core`(auto-import)/`server`/`omni-me-app`/`frontend`(mock+default); a live server smoke (zero-Gemini
boot + CSV `tick` → 1 batch event + sources CRUD incl. 400/404); a Playwright mock walkthrough (add →
"pending restart" + banner → remove → edit-prefill w/ locked name → CSV↔Subprocess field swap, 0 console
errors). **Deferred (next):** live add/remove (registry handle-tracking + `deregister`); REST source +
`ImapSource` wired into the public config builder; per-source `schedule_secs`. `(logbook)` capture for
3.7 deferred to a later drafting pass; PNGs in `logbook/_assets/config-driven-sources/`.

**STATUS 2026-06-18 — 3.6/3.7 fast-follows + 3.8 text-side COMPLETE (public-repo only).** Three slices,
all verified. **(A) live add/remove:** `SourceRegistry` now owns each scheduler task's `JoinHandle` +
gained `spawn_one`/`remove` (explicit `abort`); `AppState` carries the build context (`store` /
`projections` / `device_id` / `default_interval`); `config::build_one` factored out of
`build_generic_sources`; the `POST`/`DELETE /auto_import/sources` handlers build+spawn / abort in place
(`{"applies":"live"}`) — no restart. **(B) per-source `schedule_secs`:** honored via a *defaulted*
`AutoImportSource::poll_interval()` (CSV/subprocess carry it; `spawn_one` uses it, else the global), which
sidestepped the `SourceBuilder`-seam ripple → **zero private-overlay change**. **(C) 3.8 BYO-LLM
text-side:** new `core::llm::OpenAiCompatClient` (chat/completions; `complete_json` via `json_object` +
schema-in-prompt; `complete_with_tools` via OpenAI function-calling; key-scrubbed errors), new `[llm]`
section in `credentials.toml`, `AppState.llm_client` widened to `Arc<dyn LlmClient>`, `build_llm_client`
selects provider at boot (restart-to-apply), Settings "LLM Provider" picker + `GET/PUT /llm/config` (key
write-only — GET returns `has_key`, blank-on-save preserves). **Verified:** +22 core unit tests; full
`core`(auto-import) + `server` suites green; clippy clean across `core`/`server`/`omni-me-app`/`frontend`
(mock+default); a **live HTTP smoke** (boot selects OpenAI-compatible; CSV boots at its `schedule_secs=120`
while a live-added source lands at the global 60; live add appears in `/status` with no restart; live
delete; `/llm/config` round-trips with `has_key` + the key never returned; invalid-add→400, delete-missing
→404); a **Playwright mock walkthrough** (LLM picker reveal+save; live add → Healthy in *both* Configured
and Running; live remove; 0 console errors). PNGs in `logbook/_assets/{config-driven-sources,llm-provider}/`.
**Still deferred:** REST source + generic-`ImapSource` config wiring (3.6 tail); OpenAI-compatible vision
extractor (3.8a).

**STATUS 2026-06-19 — 3.8a + 3.9 COMPLETE (public-repo only).** Both shapes of the extensibility mechanism
now reach the *document* layer, and accounts stop being hand-maintained. **3.8a (vision extractor):** an
opt-in OpenAI-compatible `DocumentExtractor` (`[llm] vision = true`) reusing the `[llm]` config + the prompt/
schema/parse hoisted out of `gemini.rs`; `build_extractor` selects it only when opted in (default stays
Gemini/Null). **3.9 (auto-detected accounts):** the Accounts screen / net-worth roster is now **auto-derived
by type** (`Assets`/`Liabilities`/`Unmatched` seen in the ledger ∪ declared − hidden) instead of a
hand-maintained `ROSTER_FILE`; Settings became **overrides-only** (rename / Hide-Unhide), persisted via an
idempotent `AccountAdded` upsert (new `hidden` field, SET-not-CONTENT so reconcile survives); a
`known_accounts` data layer ships for the upcoming `AccountInput` typeahead. **Public-repo only** — the
defaulted/additive changes keep `omni-me-private` untouched. **Verified:** +15 core unit tests; full core
(435) + server suites green; clippy clean across core/server/app/frontend (mock+default); a Playwright mock
walkthrough proving hide drops an account off the Accounts screen + net worth, rename propagates, and the
vision toggle reveals + saves (0 console errors); PNGs in `logbook/_assets/{accounts-auto-detect,llm-provider}/`.
**Still deferred:** the `AccountInput` typeahead *component* (friction-log [M]; data layer shipped); 3.6 tail
(REST + generic-IMAP, pushed down by the user); 3.10 liquidity.

- [x] **3.1** Create private overlay crate written against `core`'s `AutoImportSource`. [M] — **done 2026-06-14**; path-deps on the public crates (pinned git-dep deferred to deploy).
- [x] **3.2** Move the bank adapters + their vendor Python driver + credential structs into the overlay; generic plumbing (`imap*.rs`, `receipts.rs`, `mime.rs`, trait) stays public. [L] — **done 2026-06-14**; public copies `git rm`'d after private verified.
- [x] **3.3** Invert source instantiation — done via the `run(RunConfig{source_builder})` seam in `server/src/lib.rs` (not literally `main.rs`); public `main.rs` = zero-sources builder. [M] — **done 2026-06-14**.
- [x] **3.4** Public app degrades gracefully to zero configured sources + zero declared accounts (no crash; manual entry / journal / budget all work). [M] — **DONE 2026-06-17.** Most rails already existed (empty source builder, drop-by-default roster, `NullExtractor`); the real gap was a **boot-time panic**: the Gemini-key resolution `.expect()`-ed a key, so a no-key / no-`credentials.toml` install crashed on startup. Now both the key resolution and the extractor's config-dir resolution degrade gracefully (empty-key client + `NullExtractor`; LLM routes error at call time, server boots). Also dropped the two bank-specific form defaults (`finances.rs` statement-import + balance-check had hard-coded a specific bank's chequing account) → neutral placeholders (`"Assets:Bank:Chequing"`). Verified: server boots with `GEMINI_API_KEY` unset + no credentials file (`/health` ok, `/auto_import/status` → `[]`).
- [x] **3.5** Subprocess-plugin runner: generic public `SubprocessSource` (command + args; helper owns creds + account-map, so "secret-ref" became "helper reads its own secrets" — a stronger boundary; schedule stays the engine's interval). The first bank adapter converted to a standalone helper binary; contract frozen in `SUBPROCESS_SOURCE_CONTRACT.md` + code types. [L] — **done 2026-06-15 (Step 2a)**; smoke-verified live. Multi-source config *registration* (declare sources via config/UI) is 3.6/3.7; CSV/REST helpers fan out from this runner.
- [x] **3.5a** Interactive source re-auth (**app-entered OTP**) per `SOURCE_REAUTH_DESIGN.md` — generic `AuthState` + status + reauth route in the **public** engine; the bank driver's login-protocol in the **private** overlay; client "Reconnect {source}" UI. Removes the SSH-to-VPS-for-OTP failure mode. **Was the hard precondition for deploying the private bank auto-import to the VPS (Phase 2) — now MET.** [M] `(logbook)` — **DONE 2026-06-17.** Server half (Step 2b, 2026-06-15): engine `AuthState`/`ReauthOutcome` + registry state-tracking + `POST /auto_import/reauth` + `auth_state`/`reauth_capable` on `GET /auto_import/status` + `SubprocessSource` reauth verb + the bank helper's `reauth` handler. Client half (Step 2c, 2026-06-17): inline "Reconnect {source}" callout + OTP field in `AutoImportRow` + `reauth_source` Tauri command, the lossy-serde seam widened at every proxy hop. Routes under `/auto_import/*` (not `/sources/*` as the design sketched). **Verified:** clippy clean (both feature configs); Playwright mock walkthrough of all 5 states (0 console errors); **real-OTP happy path E2E vs the real account** — live TOTP → `auth_state: active`, manual Fetch → `last_outcome: success`/`health: healthy` (session refreshed, not just flag cleared). `(logbook)` capture deferred to a later drafting pass; PNGs preserved in `logbook/_assets/source-reauth-reconnect/`.
- [x] **3.6** Config-driven generic sources: CSV first (+ REST / IMAP) parameterized by config. [L] — **DONE 2026-06-17 (CSV + subprocess; REST/IMAP-wiring deferred).** New server-side `sources.toml` (definitions, *not* secrets — separate from `credentials.toml` per "secrets referenced by name") + loader/`validate`/`build_generic_sources` in `core::auto_import::config`; native `core::auto_import::csv::CsvSource` (balanced `[account]`/`[Unmatched]` drafts, content-hash dedup, forgiving row-skip, header/index column mapping, configurable date format); `csv` crate feature-gated under `auto-import`. Public `server/src/main.rs` now builds from config (was `no_sources`); absent file → zero sources (3.4 holds). 15 unit tests. **Per-source `schedule_secs` DONE 2026-06-18** — honored via a defaulted `AutoImportSource::poll_interval()` (CSV/subprocess return their `schedule_secs`; `spawn_one` uses it, else global), which sidestepped the `SourceBuilder`-seam ripple entirely → no private-overlay change. **Split 2026-06-20:** REST → promoted to tracked task **3.6b** (active); generic-IMAP wiring → indefinitely deferred to the *Post-v1 / when-demanded* backlog.
- [x] **3.6b** REST config source: generic `RestSource` (HTTP GET → JSON field-map → balanced `[account]`/`[Unmatched]` drafts), API key via `credentials.toml` secret-ref; new `validate`/`build_one` arms + type-aware Settings form. Self-contained — no `build_one` signature change. [M] — split from the 3.6 tail 2026-06-20; public-completeness (the user's own REST source runs through the private overlay). **DONE 2026-06-20.** New `core::auto_import::rest::RestSource`: reqwest GET → dotted-path JSON map → balanced drafts; `pluck` dotted-path navigator (**user Learn-by-Doing** — object-keys-only via `try_fold`); `json_amount`/`json_str` coercion reusing csv's now-`pub(crate)` `parse_amount`/`stable_hash`; response-body content-hash dedup; skip-bad-record-not-fatal. **Auth = "secrets referenced by name":** new `[secrets]` map in `credentials.toml`, resolved at *fetch* time via `secret_ref` (RestSource reads its own creds → no builder-signature ripple, unlike IMAP). config `validate`/`build_one` `"rest"` arms + 6 `SourceDef` rest fields; type-aware Settings add-form gained REST (url/records_path/field-paths/auth) + `config_summary` "REST ·" line. **Verified:** 517 core + 2 new config rest tests + 7 rest-module tests, clippy clean (core auto-import / server / app / frontend mock+default, `-D warnings`), Playwright mock walkthrough (REST option → fields render → save → "REST · url → account" in list, 0 console errors); PNG `logbook/_assets/rest-source/`.
- [x] **3.7** In-app source-registration UI (Settings): add / edit / remove sources; secrets referenced by name. [M] `(logbook)` — **DONE 2026-06-17 (restart-to-apply; live add/remove deferred).** Server `GET/POST/DELETE /auto_import/sources` (file-only — they edit `sources.toml`, never the running registry, so changes apply on next restart; POST validates → 400, DELETE-missing → 404); three Tauri command proxies (untyped `serde_json::Value` — the client builds `core` without `auto-import`, so `SourceDef` isn't in scope) + bridge fns w/ stateful mock; Settings `AutoImportSection` rebuilt into **Configured sources** (Add/Edit/Remove + "pending restart" vs live-health badge) over the existing **Running now** list (reauth flow preserved). Add form is type-aware (CSV ↔ Subprocess fields swap); name is the key (locked on edit). **Live add/remove DONE 2026-06-18** — `SourceRegistry` now owns each task's `JoinHandle` + has `spawn_one`/`remove` (abort), `AppState` carries the build context (`store`/`projections`/`device_id`/`default_interval`), and the CRUD endpoints build+spawn / abort in-place → add/edit/remove apply live (no restart). UI copy + badges updated off "pending restart". PNGs in `logbook/_assets/config-driven-sources/`.
- [x] **3.8** Provider-swap: OpenAI-compatible `LlmClient` impl + Settings picker (base URL / model / key); `DocumentExtractor` on the same config rail. [M] — **TEXT-SIDE DONE 2026-06-18 (extractor deferred → 3.8a).** New `core::llm::OpenAiCompatClient` (chat/completions; `complete`/`complete_json` via `json_object`+schema-in-prompt for portability/`complete_with_tools` via OpenAI function-calling; key-scrubbed errors; 7 wiremock tests). New `[llm]` section in `credentials.toml` (`LlmProviderConfig{provider,base_url,model,api_key}`); `AppState.llm_client` widened to `Arc<dyn LlmClient>`; `build_llm_client` selects `openai_compatible` vs Gemini default at boot (restart-to-apply — the LLM is a set-once knob, unlike sources). Settings "LLM Provider" picker + `GET/PUT /llm/config` (key write-only — GET returns `has_key`, blank-on-save preserves) + Tauri proxies + stateful mock. **Deferred → 3.8a (now DONE 2026-06-19):** the OpenAI-compatible *vision* `DocumentExtractor` (separate impl; vision support varies by endpoint) — rides the same `[llm]` config behind an explicit `vision = true` opt-in.
- [x] **3.8a** OpenAI-compatible `DocumentExtractor` (vision via chat/completions) on the same `[llm]` rail; graceful degradation when the endpoint has no vision. [M] — split out of 3.8 2026-06-18. **DONE 2026-06-19 (opt-in).** New `core::extraction::openai_compat::OpenAiCompatExtractor` (vision content shape `content:[{text},{image_url:data-URI}]`; `response_format:json_object` + schema-in-prompt for portability; code-fence-tolerant parse; **images-only `supports`** — PDF excluded since most OpenAI-compatible endpoints reject raw PDF; key-scrubbed errors; 6 wiremock tests). The per-hint prompts + `response_schema` + `parse_response` were **factored out of `gemini.rs` into the `extraction` module** so both extractors share one copy. Graceful-degradation choice = **explicit `[llm] vision = true` opt-in** (default off → extractor stays Gemini/Null; never silently POSTs images to a vision-less endpoint); `build_extractor` selects it only under `provider=openai_compatible && vision && base_url+model`. Settings LLM picker gained a vision checkbox; `GET/PUT /llm/config` carry `vision`. **Verified:** +6 extractor wiremock tests + a `build_extractor`/`build_llm_client` selection test; clippy clean (core/server/app/frontend mock+default); Playwright mock walkthrough (vision toggle reveal + save). **Not separately run:** a full live-server boot against a wiremock `/chat/completions` (the wiremock extractor tests + selection test cover the logic).
- [x] **3.9** Auto-detected accounts (was: move roster into config/data + declared-accounts Settings UI). [M] — **DONE 2026-06-19 (auto-include-by-type).** Reframed per user: the account list is **auto-detected from the ledger**, not hand-maintained. New pure `core::balances` fns: `auto_roster` (Assets/Liabilities/Unmatched seen-in-journal ∪ declared − hidden → the Accounts-screen allowlist; net worth stays correct because only balance-bearing types are summed), `known_accounts` (full set, all types + ancestor segments → the autocomplete data layer), `account_type`. The hand-maintained `ROSTER_FILE` is retired to an optional balance-bearing extra-include (zero regression). Overrides (rename/hide) reuse `AccountAdded` as an idempotent **`UPSERT … SET`** (new `hidden` field on the payload + `accounts` projection + `AccountRow`; SET-not-CONTENT preserves reconcile state). New Tauri commands `list_known_accounts` / `list_detected_accounts` / `set_account_override`; Settings **Accounts** section (rename + Hide/Unhide, overrides-only). **Verified:** +9 core unit tests (incl. SET-preserves-reconcile); clippy clean across the board; **Playwright mock walkthrough proved it end-to-end** — Settings lists 5 detected accounts; hiding Meridian:AED flips it to Unhide AND drops it from the Finances Accounts screen + net worth; renaming Globepay→"Globepay (everyday)" propagates to the Accounts screen; 0 console errors. **Next (immediate follow-on):** the shared `AccountInput` typeahead component (friction-log [M]) consumes `list_known_accounts` (data layer shipped here; `invoke_list_known_accounts` is wired + `#[allow(dead_code)]` until the component lands).
- [x] **3.10** Liquidity-aware `can_i_afford` (per-account `is_liquid` flag drives the verdict; same accounts table; `AffordVerdict.policy_label` → "Liquid assets − next month's recurring"). [S] — **DONE 2026-06-20.** Opt-in `is_liquid` bool threaded payload→projection→`AccountRow`→`AccountSummary`; `sum_liquid_assets` (`None`=nothing marked → net-worth fallback, `Some(0)`=marked-but-empty → can't-afford); `can_i_afford` rewritten (liquid pool when marked, net-worth fallback else, early-return when neither pool — user Learn-by-Doing, incl. the match-with-early-return fix); Settings "Mark Liquid" toggle + badge; `type_complexity` alias on the mock override store. **Verified:** 438 core + 12 server tests, clippy clean ×4 configs (`-D warnings`), Playwright verdict flip (Yes→No on marking Globepay:CAD liquid) + revert, 0 console errors; PNGs `logbook/_assets/liquidity-afford/`.
- [x] **3.11** Synthetic-fixtures discipline: adopt before any parser work against real data. [XS] — **DONE 2026-06-20.** Audit clean: only `extraction/README.md` is committed under `tests/fixtures/`; `.gitignore` covers `.reference/`+`surreal_data/`+`blobs/`; no committed journals/statements/DBs; the lone committed receipt image (`tauri-app/frontend/src/mocks/receipt-loblaws.png`) confirmed **synthetic** by user. Discipline now written down as a committed convention in `core/tests/README.md` (synthetic/inline = committed; real data → gitignored `.reference/` behind `#[ignore]` skip-graceful tests; enforced by mechanism not vigilance). **Correction:** `.reference/paisa/` is the *real* hledger journal (~5,826 txns) — the Phase 4 import source — so the *data* stays gitignored-but-present, **not** deletable. **Refinement (user challenge — don't keep permanently-ignored tests):** deleted `core/tests/journal_import_paisa.rs`; its two `#[ignore]` tests gave zero CI coverage and every path they touched (parse_journal file-walk/include-glob/elision/error-collection/per-account stats; A2 rewriter) is already covered by synthetic `TempDir` CI tests in `journal_import.rs` — their only value was a one-time pre-cleanup scale validation (POC 0.1b, done). `core/tests/README.md` now states the principle: synthetic-runs-in-CI is the coverage; `#[ignore]` is only for un-synthesizable real-resource diagnostics (e.g. real-Gemini `extraction_integration`), never a home for deterministic-logic coverage.
- [x] **3.12** mylearnbase follow-up: re-shoot Accounts screenshot generic + update alt text. [S] — **DONE 2026-06-21**, superseded by the full public-identity sanitization (all 7 omni-me logbook posts re-shot from the sanitized mock + prose/alt/citation cleanup; see `project.md` session log).
- [x] **3.13** Verify: clean clone builds + runs zero-config; overlay build pulls real sources; BYO-LLM points at an alternate endpoint and works. [S] — **DONE 2026-06-20 (residuals accepted by user).** (1) **Public zero-config boot live-verified:** empty `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` + no key → `/health` ok, `/auto_import/status` `[]`, `sources=0`, NullExtractor fallback, no panic. (2) **Overlay `cargo check` clean against the post-3.10 engine** — proves 3.10's additive (`#[serde(default)]`) changes didn't break the composition root. (3) **BYO-LLM via this session's green tests** — 7 `OpenAiCompatClient` wiremock tests (mock `/chat/completions`: complete/json/tool-calls/error/rate-limit/key-not-leaked) + `build_llm_client_selects_openai_compatible_text` boot-selection. **Residuals (accepted, address if they bite):** overlay pulling *real* bank sources at runtime = user-owned (live-verified earlier in 3.5/3.5a); no single full server↔mock-LLM e2e boot (client+selection tests cover the logic, same as 3.8a's note). **Also:** removed stale pre-split public-server data (`surreal_data/`+`blobs/` at repo root).

## Phase 4 — Real-data go-live import (Cycle-3 6.5) *(PULLED AHEAD OF Phase 2 — 2026-06-21)*

**Sequencing (2026-06-21):** done **before** Phase 2 deploy — real data needs to be in hand to push
while testing the deployment.

**Placement (2026-06-21) — Phase 4 needs no repo changes:** the import path
(`core::journal_import` + the projections + R2 query + base-currency setting) is generic and already
**public**; it imports *any* hledger journal. The real journal, the resulting SurrealDB, and
`credentials.toml` are **gitignored — they live only on the work machine, in neither repo** (no leak).
So Phase 4 is a **local operation** run on the machine that holds the cleaned journal (the
data-cleanup machine), not a code change. Only if cleanup surfaced *roster-specific* import/rewrite
rules would a small piece land in the private overlay; the generic A2 rewriter stays public.
**Phase 2's split is already homed** (see the Phase 2 note): the "deploy to my box" pipeline + the
go-live image (which runs the *private* overlay binary) live private; the public repo keeps
build/test/publish of the bank-free image.

- [x] **4.1** Import the cleaned journal end-to-end — event emission → SurrealDB + journal-file projection round-trip (the part 6.4 stopped short of). Ends the cheap-breaking-changes window. [M] — **DONE 2026-06-22.** Source is **ledger-cli format (not hledger** — corrects the planning note); needed generic public-engine parser fixes first (cost-faithful elided balancing, transaction/header-tag capture via a defaulted `TransactionRecordedPayload.tags`, `P`-directive strip, status-marker normalization, digit-commodity quoting, `raw_balances` zero-cost fallback). Headless one-shot runner + balance/probe validators + a re-import workflow README live in **`omni-me-private/examples/`** (real anchor data → private repo, not public). Idempotent for txns (content-hash `txn_id`); journal notes mint ULIDs → re-run needs a fresh DB. A2 rewriter OFF.
- [x] **4.2** Validate projected balances vs the source journal; dashboard/accounts reflect real data. [S] — **DONE 2026-06-22.** App-projected per-account/per-commodity balances reproduce `ledger -f main.ledger bal` **exactly** (full path: events → `budget.journal` projection → `core::ledger::balances`), via temp-DB dry-run *and* the real app DB. Journal/notes counts reconcile (1:1 across journal + generic + skipped templates).
- [x] **4.3** Exercise the deferred Cycle-3 real-DB paths now that real data flows: R2 query (7.2) + base-currency setting (7.3) against the live SurrealDB. [S] — **DONE 2026-06-22.** R2 `core::query` runs over the live transaction set (tag/account/commodity predicates); CONVENTIONS §8 tag-filtered anchors reproduce **exactly** through the persisted posting tags (institutions-in-tags confirmed). base-currency conversion exercised: book value via `ledger-utils` implied prices from the 2-commodity cost legs; only commodities that never traded directly against base drop (no conversion chaining) — ~0.3% vs `ledger -X CAD`, an app valuation-engine trait, not an import defect.

**Phase 4 GUI-VALIDATED & CLOSED 2026-06-22.** Ran the actual desktop app against the real embedded DB — built standalone via the new `tauri-app/scripts/desktop-build.sh` (desktop analog of `android-build.sh`; `cargo tauri build --debug` with a `--config` override embedding the **release** frontend, because a `cargo tauri dev` binary run standalone serves the UI from a dead localhost dev server → blank page) — and confirmed the import end-to-end in the GUI: net worth + per-account/per-commodity balances match the `ledger bal` oracle (cumulative reconciliation, 0 diffs), the journal calendar is fully populated, the Accounts screen renders. Full DB rebuild flow (move-aside backup → temp-DB dry-run → oracle reconcile → real import → `probe_realdb`) absorbed a regenerated corpus (journal import isn't idempotent). **Three generic UI bugs found + fixed (synthetic tests, commit-safe):** (1) any per-account override (liquid/hide/rename) appended an `account` directive the Rust `ledger-utils` parser rejects, collapsing every balance view → `core::ledger::prep_content` now strips `account` blocks (+ test `balances_skips_account_directives`). (2) base-currency money rendered 24-digit decimals → rounded to 2 dp at the `commands::budget` view boundary; native precision preserved. (3) the journal editor hung on "Initializing editor environment…" → unified the `cfg(debug_assertions)`-split loader to one polling path (the release-only `onload` path never resolved in an embedded webview, and was never exercised since Android only ran the debug/polling path). **Deferred → post-launch fix cycle (see Carried backlog):** per-institution tag-breakdown drill-down on the Accounts view; balance-cache perf; JournalFile account-directive append-dedup.

## Phase 5 — Editor feel + properties *(partly dogfooding-driven)* `(logbook)`

- [ ] **5.1** Inline properties panel (decision B) above the body; typed widgets for date / tags / 3 reflection keys; raw escape hatch for legacy props (`legacy_properties` / `has_legacy_properties` already exist). [L]
- [ ] **5.2** YAML↔form model kept in sync with the editor; the form emits parser-safe YAML. [M]
- [ ] **5.3** Harden `is_complete` (`core/src/events/notes_projection.rs:282`) to accept block lists / reordering / blank lines (also helps Obsidian-import compat). [S]
- [ ] **5.4** Typing-feel polish — open bucket, populated from the friction log as daily use surfaces it. [—]

## Phase 6 — Release polish

- [ ] **6.1** App logo (desktop + Android assets; replace default Tauri). [S]
- [ ] **6.2** Branch-gate workflow: feature branches + merge gates to protect stable. [S]
- [ ] **6.3** v1 semver stamp + git tag. [XS]
- [ ] **6.4** Archive + reset `project.md` (session log + status history → `.archive/`, leaving a lean current-state doc) once stable-v1 ships — it's grown unwieldy carrying every session's detail. Consider the same for `tasks.md`. Tie to the v1 tag so the archived snapshot is a clean cut point. [S]

## Running friction log *(fill during dogfooding; triage into the live phase)*

- [x] **Account-field autocomplete + unknown-account affordance** (dogfooding 2026-06-17). **DONE
  2026-06-20 (public-repo / frontend-only).** Shared `AccountInput` (`components/account_input.rs`):
  controlled `value`+`on_input` (each site keeps its save closure), suggestion dropdown + keyboard
  nav (Arrow/Enter/Escape), `AccountMode::{Add,Query}`-driven unknown affordance (`Add`→"New account
  — will be created", `Query`→amber "No such account in the ledger"), fed by an `AccountSuggestions`
  root context (one `invoke_list_known_accounts` fetch, `refresh()` after account-creating saves).
  Matching = **case-insensitive prefix, cap 8** (user Learn-by-Doing); `is_known` case-insensitive to
  match. Wired into all **7** account-path sites (TransactionForm/Budget/NoMatch/StatementImport/
  Journal-rename → Add; QueryBuilder/BalanceCheck → Query). Clippy clean both feature configs;
  Playwright mock walkthrough green (0 console errors; PNGs `logbook/_assets/account-input-typeahead/`).
  **Deferred to dogfooding:** segment-aware / leaf-by-short-name matching (`coffee`→`Expenses:Food:Coffee`)
  until the mental model is clear; the Query-mode case-strictness nuance. Original ask:
  Everywhere the user types an account name, offer a **type-ahead dropdown** of matching accounts
  (search-box style); and make it **visually clear when the typed account is not yet in the ledger**.
  - **Build once, reuse everywhere:** a single shared `AccountInput` typeahead component, not a
    per-form re-implementation (shared-UI-shape principle). **Input sites to cover:** TransactionForm
    (add/edit posting), `QueryBuilderView` account predicate (R2), budget setup (category = account),
    reconciliation no-match category fill-in (`resolve_unmatched`), balance-check account field,
    journal-import rename inputs.
  - **Suggestion source:** the `accounts` table once **3.9** lands (declared accounts), likely unioned
    with accounts actually *seen* in the ledger/journal projection. **Hard dependency on 3.9** (lifts
    the roster into a queryable table) — do after it.
  - **Unknown-account affordance is context-dependent:** in an **add** context a non-existent account
    is *allowed* but flagged "New account — will be created" (catches typos without blocking intent);
    in a **query** context, flag "No such account in the ledger" so an empty result reads as "this
    account doesn't exist", not "no matching transactions" (consistent with the empty-search-shows-
    nothing principle).
  - **Open design Qs:** does "exists" mean *declared* (accounts table) or *seen in ledger* (used in ≥1
    posting)? — they diverge. Segment-aware completion over the `:`-hierarchy (mirroring the R2
    account matcher) so typing `Expenses:F` suggests `Expenses:Food` etc.?
  - Triage: data dependency rides on **Phase 3 / 3.9**; the cross-app UI layer could land as its own
    3.x or in **Phase 5** (editor/typing feel). [M]

- **Android build-pipeline root cause — resolved 2026-06-08.** Symptom: no JS/frontend change
  reached the device all session despite many rebuild+reinstall cycles (only native Kotlin
  changes took effect). **Not a cache.** Cause: `tauri-build` **embeds `frontendDist` into the
  `.so`** and the WebView serves from there; `frontendDist`=debug + `npm run build` only
  refreshing the *release* dir ⇒ the APK baked in a **frozen stale debug frontend**. (An earlier
  version of this entry claiming "Android ships release via `copy:android:release`, ignores
  `frontendDist`" was **wrong** — corrected.) Fix: `scripts/android-build.sh [debug|release]`
  overrides `frontendDist`→release for the build only via `--config`; dev flow untouched.
  Verified: `.so` 51→40.5 MB, served index 512 B hashed, served bundle has the 1.10 listener,
  caret clears keyboard on device. Sweep `clean:release` also added (still valid — release dir
  accretes hashed wasms that all get embedded). Docs corrected in `tauri-app/BUILD.md`.
  **Deferred post-split:** real `devUrl` so `frontendDist`=release everywhere; remove dead
  `copy:android:release`; stop committing `editor.bundle.js`.

## Carried backlog (slot into a phase or pull from the friction log)

**Post-launch fix cycle (from Phase 4 GUI validation, 2026-06-22):**
- [ ] Per-institution (tag) breakdown drill-down on the Accounts view — group an account's postings by `institution`/`product` tag via the existing `core::query` tag layer (the payoff of institutions-in-tags; `probe_realdb` already resolves the splits exactly). [M]
- [ ] Balance-cache perf — `account_summaries` / `dashboard_summary` / `list_detected_accounts` each re-read + re-parse the full `budget.journal` per call; cache parsed balances (invalidate on new budget events). [M]
- [ ] JournalFile `account`-directive append-dedup — the projection appends a fresh `account …` line per override toggle (DB upsert is idempotent, but the rendered file accretes duplicates; harmless now that `prep_content` strips them, but it bloats the file). [S]

**Phase-5 reconciliation/import deferrals (from Cycle 3):**
- [ ] Inline-edit per detected recurring pattern before confirm (today: dismiss + rescan). [S]
- [ ] Balancing-posting affordance for hidden-fee resolution on merge (wire/FX fees). [S]
- [ ] Credit-card CSV variant + real-export format verification (synthetic-tested only). [S]
- [ ] Reconciliation candidate engine: FX-spanning (cross-currency) matches. [M]

**Deferred stretch (from Cycle 2/3):**
- [ ] Daily Flow consistency visualizer redesign — frequency-aware (was 7-day hard-coded). [M]
- [ ] `BufferEvent::FlushFailed` → `StatusReporter` "stuck buffer" indicator. [S]
- [ ] Configurable `FORCE_GENERIC_DIRS` (hardcoded to `Work/`). [S]
- [ ] `auto_close_scheduler::AppState.event_store` → `Arc<dyn EventStore>` parity. [XS]
- [ ] Seconds duration unit on routine items (breaking event-schema change, 16 touch points). [M]
- [ ] `cargo:rerun-if-env-changed=TAURI_DEV_HOST` upstream contribution to `tauri-build`. [XS]

**Post-v1 / when-demanded:**
- [ ] PWA fallback (deferred Cycles 1-3).
- [ ] Veryfi `DocumentExtractor` impl (trait + routing scaffold already in place).
- [ ] ExchangeRate-API auto-rates for the manual-FX currency (replaces manual per-statement entry).
- [ ] LLM-translated NL queries for R2 (evaluate; ship only if real usage demands).
- [ ] PaddleOCR sidecar (escape hatch from Cycle-3 7.11).
- [ ] C1 email auto-fetch (vs paste); R3 self-employment dashboards; R4 tax-form validation.
- [ ] Generic IMAP config source — wire the existing public `ImapSource` into the config builder. Indefinitely deferred 2026-06-20 (needs `build_one` to thread `db`+`extractor`+async into both call sites, *and* a handler-policy design call — a config IMAP source = receipt importer by sender-pattern?). Not personally needed: the user's email sources (statements + receipts) run through the private overlay's `build_imap_sources`.
- [ ] SurrealDB bump past 3.0.4 — **lockstep across both repos** (public + private overlay each pin their own lock; out-of-sync re-floats the overlay to 3.1 + `diskann`, which fails to compile on the current toolchain, rust#100013). No vector-search usage today, so no pull; revisit when vector search is wanted or the toolchain resolves #100013. Patch 3.0.x bumps are safe meanwhile. [S]

## Cycle 5+ filed

- Inbox management feature (user's "far future dream").
- Open Banking Canada evaluation (when bank adoption matures).
