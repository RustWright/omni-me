# NEXT

⛔ **Next action, and what is blocked on him. Nothing else.** (His instruction, 2026-09-27.) Decisions,
findings and what-not-to-re-survey live in `tasks.md`; rationale lives in `docs/src/` and at the edit
site. ⛔ If a line here could be derived from either, it does not belong here — point, do not restate.

## ▶ NEXT ACTION — stage 4, Phase B: design the old-mail backfill (B-b)
The go-live sequence and its rulings: `tasks.md` § release, "Stage 4: the go-live sequence". ⛔ Do not
re-ask them. B-a and B1–B3 are built (marked there). B-b is the last Phase B item and the largest:
a design pass first, bringing him a proposal (retention category list + a timer per category,
which are his), then build. Then the merge and the rehearsal on a fresh clone of live.
⛔ Live is the pause: every Phase C to F step waits for his go, one at a time.

⛔ **Never `cargo build`/`test` on this box** — `check`/`fmt`/`clippy` only; anything that links
goes to CI. `project-dev-machines-and-build-limits`. Tooling: `~/omni-dev-tools/devsrv.py`.
Dev workflows: `--ref dev/untested-overlay`. Before any overlay build, dispatch overlay `ci.yml`
with `-f public_ref=<full public SHA>` (`project-overlay-ci-blind-spot`).

## ⛔ Waiting on him
- **September statements** for the paisa importers (go-live E2). Nothing in Phase E starts without them.
- **`/etc/omni-me/credentials-agent.toml`** on the box, `[llm]` only (+ `auth_token` if set), before F1.
- **GitHub Support purge** of the pre-S-W1 commits (optional, his ruling): they are still served
  by SHA. `tasks.md` § release item 4 has what to name.
- **F3's open half**: whether multi-page reading should be told pages can repeat.
- **Tap targets**: a visual redesign across screens, his call. `tasks.md` § Open.
- **R27's account side**: his to check; ⛔ no list of affected runs exists, by his decision.
- **The public-repo identity scrub**: authorised, end of a session only. `tasks.md` § Owed at cycle close.
